# HFT-FPGA-Simulation: High-Frequency Trading Hardware Acceleration (Simulation Only)

This repository is focused on learning, designing, and simulating core hardware acceleration techniques used in **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** systems using **Verilog/SystemVerilog**, **Verilator**, and **GTKWave**. The goal is to build, verify, and analyze simple trading system components entirely in simulation, showcasing how hardware can drastically reduce latency in trading pipelines.

This project is entirely simulation-based: **no physical FPGA hardware is required**.

## üéØ Learning Objective

**Learning Low Latency, Systems level understanding from both software and hardware perspective!**

---

## üöÄ What This Repository Covers

* Simulated design of low-latency trading pipelines (tick-to-trade)
* Market data parsing, decision logic, and order signal generation in Verilog
* Hardware-software integration concepts using Python for dummy data and visualization
* Cycle-accurate simulation and waveform analysis

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used

### 1. **Verilator** ‚Äî Verilog Simulator and Compiler

* **Why:** Converts Verilog designs into cycle-accurate C++ simulators. Faster than traditional simulators and widely used in FPGA and ASIC development.
* **Install:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git make autoconf g++ flex bison help2man
git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
cd verilator
autoconf && ./configure
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

### 2. **GTKWave** ‚Äî Waveform Viewer

* **Why:** Provides graphical visualization of simulation results (timing diagrams, signal states).
* **Install:**

```bash
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

### 3. **Python + Libraries** ‚Äî Data Generation & Visualization

* **Why:** Used to generate dummy market data (packet streams) and visualize latency comparisons. Integrates with Verilator simulations.
* **Install:**

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install scapy matplotlib
```

### 4. **Optional: Vivado or Quartus**

* **Why:** Industry-standard FPGA development environments for actual hardware synthesis (not required for simulation).
